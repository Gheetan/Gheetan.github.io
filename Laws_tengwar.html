                We, the people of The Great Gheetan Empire, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish these laws for The Great Gheetan Empire.
                We, the sovereign rulers and citizens of the Great Gheetan Empire, affirm the guiding principles of justice, order, and prosperity that have sustained our civilization for centuries. By divine will and imperial decree, these laws and regulations are established to ensure the fair governance of our empire, the protection of its citizens, and the maintenance of harmony within our borders. All subjects of the Great Gheetan Empire, from the highest noble to the humblest citizen, are subject to these laws, which are designed to preserve the common good, safeguard the divine authority of the Emperor, and protect the rich traditions of our people.</p>
